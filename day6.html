    <!--  css what is css
       cascading style sheet
       its styling of our webpages
       we use to style html document
       its works with html to control the layout , color , fonts & spacing of elements 
       how to include style?
       three ways to insert css
       Inline css
       internal css
       external css
       Inline css :- we can include style directly within the html elemnt using the style attribtes:
       eg
       Internal css :- Incluse css styles diretly withing the style tags in the head section of our html document
       External css :- create  sepatate file & link it to our html file using the link tag
       where we can write link yes
        u can wrte ill tell u
        inline style quick/fast but its good for small adjustment but its nt good for large scale project
        thats why we prefer to internal or external style becuz of largere project  but larger project alwyas prefer external
        we can consider external style for big project becuz mutilple pages form a
        now next topic color topic
         we can write color three ways 
         first simplay way , second rgb , third hex hexa code
         color  ko two ways se kiya jata hai background or foreground
         color : purple :its simple way foregorund color 
         rgb means red green blue 3 channels its a way to define color using a combination of these three primary color red blue green
         value ranging (0to 255)
        (0,0 ,0),(255,255,255) hum 
        third  hexadecimal color code is a way to represent color using a combination of six character
        the format is #RRGGBB,#ffffff ,jo first ff woh red ko denote krta hai jo next hai woh green ko jo next blue ko RR means ff GG FF , BB ,ff
        Heaxdecimal base 16 ka hota hai
        hum letts dete hai jaise ki ,0,1 ,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F :::sixteen hote hai 0 to 9 A to F
        eaxample #ff0000,
